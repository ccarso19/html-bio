<h1>Welcome to my new homepage!!!</h1>
<p>you probably want to know a little about me. Well, Several years ago, I made a career change from the intelligence community to an information technology professional. Being an analyst has helped me develop analytical skills become an effective communicator and collaborator. I'm a father of several beautiful children, a Marine Corps veteran, a Board Member for a small nonprofit, a student pursuing my Bachelor's Degree, and actively growing in the realm of technology. I believe nearly any situation can become an opportunity to expand my knowledge and hone my rational-thinking skills. I am ambitious and goal-oriented and dedicate myself to mastering a subject and gaining relevant skills. I am skeptical by nature but open to changing my opinions when the facts prove them wrong. Rather than hunches or half-baked assumptions, I base my conclusions on research and analysis.</p>
